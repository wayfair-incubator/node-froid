guidelines on contributing and reporting bugs that we ask you to review.
Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the

should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and
helping you finalize your pull requests. In that spirit of mutual respect, we
endeavour to review incoming issues and pull requests within 10 days, and will

Please note that all of your interactions in the project are subject to our
[**Code of Conduct**][code of conduct]. This includes creation of issues or pull
requests, commenting on issues or pull requests, and extends to all interactions
in any real-time space (eg. Slack, Discord, etc).

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a new issue, please ensure that the issue was not already
reported or fixed by searching through our [**Bugs**][bugs].

When creating a new issue, please be sure to include a **title and clear
description**, as much relevant information as possible, and, if possible, a
test case.

**If you discover a security bug, please do not report it through GitHub.
Instead, please see security procedures in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).**

### 💡 Feature Requests

Please file an issue to suggest new features. Vote on feature requests by adding
a 👍. This helps maintainers prioritize what to work on.

## Sending Pull Requests

Before sending a new pull request, take a look at existing pull requests and
issues to see if the proposed change or fix has been discussed in the past, or
if the change was already implemented but not yet released.

We expect new pull requests to include tests for any affected behavior, and, as
we follow semantic versioning, we may reserve breaking changes until the next
major version release.
